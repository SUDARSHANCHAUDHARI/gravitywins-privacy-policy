# GravityWins Privacy Policy

**Last updated: January 1, 2026**

This Privacy Policy applies to the mobile application **GravityWins**, published by **Sudarshan Tech Labs**.

**Official website:** https://sudarshantechlabs.com  
**Company email:** sudarshantechlabs@gmail.com  
**Developer contact:** sunny.sudarshan@gmail.com

GravityWins (“we,” “our,” or “us”) is a personal drop-tracking app. This Privacy Policy explains what information the app collects, how it is used, and the choices you have. By installing or using GravityWins, you agree to the practices described below.

## Information We Collect

GravityWins is designed to work primarily offline. The app stores the following information locally on your device:

- **Drop activity and statistics:** Timestamps of recorded drops, daily and lifetime totals, streaks, and last-drop time.
- **Drop context:** Optional notes and tags you add to individual drops.
- **User preferences:** Notification settings, quiet-hour schedule, focus-mode timers, home layout choice, telemetry toggle, daily goals, milestone unlocks, webhook configuration, and export or reminder preferences.
- **Weekly digest summaries:** Aggregated counts (for example, drops per week or busiest hour or weekday) generated for the in-app digest.
- **Telemetry events (optional):** Basic app-usage events such as **drop detected**, **history exported**, or **contact request started**. When enabled, these events are buffered in memory only and are not transmitted in the current build.

The app **does not** collect precise or approximate location data, contact lists, photos, audio, or persistent device identifiers. Accelerometer readings are processed on-device solely to detect drops. Raw sensor data is not stored.

## Information You Choose to Share

- **Contact form:** If you use the **Need help or want to contribute?** option, your name, reply email, subject, and message are placed into an email draft addressed to **sudarshantechlabs@gmail.com** or **sunny.sudarshan@gmail.com**. The app does not store a copy. Sending the message is handled entirely by your chosen email provider.
- **Data exports:** When you export history as CSV or JSON, files are created in the app’s private cache and shared using Android’s system share sheet. Data leaves your device only if you choose a destination such as email or cloud storage.
- **Webhooks:** If you enable webhooks, drop summaries (counts, humor line, timestamps, and if you opt in device model, manufacturer, and Android version) are sent to the HTTPS endpoint you configure. **Sudarshan Tech Labs** does not operate or control that endpoint.

## How We Use Information

All information is used strictly to provide app functionality:

- Maintain drop counts, streaks, and history
- Drive focus mode, notifications, widgets, and reminders
- Generate weekly digests and diagnostic timelines
- Send optional exports and webhooks initiated by you
- Improve the experience using optional telemetry (currently stored only in memory)

GravityWins does **not** display ads and does **not** sell, rent, or monetize user data.

## Storage and Retention

- Drop history, preferences, and digests are stored locally using Android DataStore and Room.
- Exported CSV or JSON files are stored temporarily in a cache directory. The app keeps up to **five** recent exports.
- Telemetry events are stored in memory only and cleared when the app restarts.
- Webhook dispatch logs are held in memory and limited to the **five** most recent attempts.

Uninstalling GravityWins removes all locally stored data from your device.

## Sharing and Transfers

**Sudarshan Tech Labs** does not send data to its own servers or to third-party analytics services.

Data leaves your device only when you:

- Send an email using the contact option
- Share an export file through another app or service
- Enable and configure a webhook

Any further handling of that data is governed by the recipient service’s privacy policy.

## Your Choices and Controls

- **Telemetry:** Enable or disable in Settings → Diagnostics.
- **Drop history:** Edit notes and tags, delete entries, or clear all history.
- **Exports:** Delete shared files through the destination app or by clearing the app cache.
- **Webhooks:** Enable or disable at any time and control whether device information is included.
- **Notifications and quiet hours:** Fully configurable or can be disabled entirely.
- **Data removal:** Uninstalling the app deletes all stored data.

## Security

Data remains on your device unless you choose to share it. Webhooks use HTTPS when supported by the destination. Because exports and emails are user-directed, ensure you trust the recipients you select. Local data is not encrypted at rest beyond standard Android platform protections.

## Children’s Privacy

GravityWins is intended for a general audience and is not directed at children under the age of **13**. If you believe a child has provided personal information, please contact us so appropriate action can be taken.

## Changes to This Policy

This Privacy Policy may be updated to reflect new features or legal requirements. Any changes will be posted on this page, and the **Last updated** date will be revised accordingly.
